			<p>I have been a dedicated fine artist since childhood. I changed my focus to visual communication design with an emphasis in fine arts in order to utilize my passion for art in a more modern (promising) form. <a href="http://mhoblin.github.io/p2-resume/">See my resume here.</a> Most of my work is fine art and expressive design, but lately I have been dabbling in more serious, professional styles and I am really enjoying the outcomes. My style tile represents this interest since I am using very neutral colors and clear, legible and readable fonts. I want to be perceived as a professional, so I designed my logo to portray just that. It is clean, reproducable, and has a unique icon - a hedgehog. The hedgehog makes my logo a little more personable since it gives the logo a more friendly (cute animal) appearance. Because even the hedgehog is designed thoughtfully, the animal doesn't ruin the professional look. </p>
